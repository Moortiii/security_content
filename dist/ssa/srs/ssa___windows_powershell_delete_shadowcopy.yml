description: This following analytic detects PowerShell command to delete shadow copy
  using the WMIC PowerShell module. This technique was seen used by a recent adversary
  to deploy DarkSide Ransomware where it executed a child process of PowerShell to
  execute a hex encoded command to delete shadow copy. This hex encoded command was
  able to be decrypted by PowerShell log.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging (4104) on some or all endpoints. Additional setup
  here https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/UBA/5.0.4.1/GetDataIn/AddPowerShell#Configure_module_logging_for_PowerShell.
known_false_positives: It is possible administrators may delete shadow copies. Filter
  as needed or monitor.
