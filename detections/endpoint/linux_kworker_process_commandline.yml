description:  This analytic looks for suspicious process kworker commandline in a linux machine. 
  kworker process name or thread are common name of kernel thread in linux process. So it is really a suspicious event a normal user process 
  contain this process commandline. This technique was seen in cyclopsblink malware to blend its core and other of its child process as normal 
  kworker on the compromised machine. This detection might be a good pivot to look for other IOC related to cyclopsblink malware or attacks.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes 
  where  Processes.process = "*[kworker/*" OR Processes.parent_process = "*[kworker/*"
  by  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id 
  Processes.process_guid Processes.dest Processes.user 
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
  | `linux_kworker_process_commandline_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from
  Splunkbase.
