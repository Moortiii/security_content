description: On May 3rd, 2022, Splunk published a security advisory for a Path traversal in search parameter that can potentiall allow SPL injection. An attacker can cause the application to load data from incorrect endpoints, urls leading to outcomes such as running arbitrary SPL queries.
how_to_implement: This detection does not require you to ingest any new data. The detection does require the ability to search the _internal index. This search will provide search UI requests with path traversal parameter ("../../../../../../../../../") which shows exploitation attempts.
known_false_positives: This search may find additional path traversal exploitation attempts.
